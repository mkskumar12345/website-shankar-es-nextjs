                    <p>By publishing an advertisement on the Site (which includes creating an online profile), each Offeror
                      User is authorizing us to promote it for its greater visibility in our discretion and to operate the
                      Service so as to facilitate maximum effectiveness in relevant geographical markets. By creating an
                      online profile or placing an advertisement on the Site, Offeror Users confirm they are of legal age in
                      the relevant jurisdiction, that they are the person identified in that profile and that they have not
                      been coerced in any way to offer services.</p>

                    <p>Offeror Users are made aware that we take payment for the Paid Service through our payment service
                      provider, whose terms and conditions govern transactions between Offeror Users. We are not responsible
                      for the acts, omissions or defaults of the payment provider. In the event of breach of these terms, we

                    <h6 className="tnc-heading fw-600 fs-22">Age Verification Procedure</h6>

                    <p>
                      Offeror Users agree that the Company may subject the publication of advertisements to
                      verification of the minimum age requirements, either in an automated form, through an
                      external service provider, or through manual verification, in the event that automatic
                      verification is not possible. In particular, for this purpose, the Company may ask the
                      Offeror User to provide his/her identity document and we shall follow our <a
                        href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
                      guidelines for this purpose. For this purpose, the Company uses the third-party service
                      provider Yoti of the company Yoti Limited, based in London, 6th Floor, 107 Leadenhall
                      St, EC3A 4AF (United Kingdom), as a data processor, to acquire information about the
                      identity of the Offeror User from the provided ID and to verify that the selfie matches the
                      photo on the ID. As set out in the Privacy Policy in more detail, the Company shall only
                      use the data contained in the ID for the sole purpose of verifying the User’s account
                      information relating to their age and identity.
                    </p>



                    <h6 className="tnc-heading fw-600 fs-22">Acceptable Use Policy</h6>

                    <p>Users undertake not to use the Service provided by the Site either improperly or contrary to the
                      provisions of law, regulations, rules, notifications, directions, orders, circulars, guidelines rules
                      of ethics and good conduct of the network services (<em>netiquette). Users, in particular, undertake
                        not to transmit through the Site material of offensive and libellous nature, discriminatory,

                    pornographic, paedophile, vulgar, blasphemous or which is some way contrary to the applicable laws and

                <p>Offeror Users are responsible for complying with all applicable laws with respect to the content of
                  their advertisement. In particular, Users must not advertise any services which it would be unlawful
                  to perform within their jurisdiction and they must not include any material which infringes applicable
                  criminal law.</p>

                <p>Offeror Users warrant that they are the data subjects of or that they have the explicit and informed
                  consent of all persons whose personal data is included in any advertisement placed by them and that

                  intellectual property rights of any third person without having the permission of that third person.

                <p>Placing advertisements purporting to be from someone or including the data of someone who has not
                  consented to those advertisements being placed is a serious breach of these Terms of Use and may lead
                  to accounts being closed and Offeror Users responsible banned from the Site.</p>

                  have no control over any materials which may be sent directly to that email address, whether by other
